I am a Data Scientist at [Product Health](http://producthealth.com/) where I design and develop analytic services that provide useful insights to our customers on their products. Before moving to London I spent two years working at [GE Transportation](http://www.getransportation.com/) in Paris as a system architect building from scratch the automatic driving system for driverless trains. I have a Ph.D. in Machine Learning over which I focused on the development of a fault detection application for railway signalling devices to help [SNCF](http://www.sncf.com/) on the forecast of their maintenance operations.
